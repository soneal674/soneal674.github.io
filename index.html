      Hello, and thanks for checking out my personal web page. This is a small
      project that sounded like a good way to cut my teeth on web development,
      and as a resume enhancer, to keep that slimmed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might get around to hosting tools I want to build for gaming,
      journaling, or anything else that seems useful and can be contained in a
      webpage.
