        Hello, and thanks for checking out my personal web page. This is a small
        project that sounded like a good way to cut my teeth on web development,
        and as a resume enhancer, to keep that slimmed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might get around to hosting tools I want to build for gaming,
        journaling, or anything else that seems useful and can be contained in a
        webpage.
      </p>
