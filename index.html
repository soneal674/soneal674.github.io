        <p>Hello, and thanks for checking out my personal web page. This is a small project that sounded like a good way to cut my teeth on web development,
        and as a resume enhancer, to keep that slimmed down. I might get around to hosting tools I want to build for gaming, journaling, or
        anything else that seems useful and can be contained in a webpage.</p>
